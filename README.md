# ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed Test (using SFML)

A simple, interactive typing speed test application built with C++ and SFML. This project allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy against a collection of random passages. It provides instant color-coded feedback as well.
## ‚ú® Features

* **Random Passages**: Practice with a variety of randomized passage; lyrics from EDMüòÖ
* **Real-time Metrics**: Measures typing speed (Words Per Minute - WPM) and accuracy dynamically as you type.
* **Instant Visual Feedback**:
    * **Green** for correctly typed characters.
    * **Red** for errors or mistyped characters.
* **Performance Summary**: Get a detailed breakdown of your WPM and accuracy at the end of each test, along with personalized feedback.
* **Clean UI**: A straightforward user interface for convinience :)

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **C++**: The core programming language for the application logic.
* **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**: Used for all graphical rendering (window, text, shapes, colors), input handling (keyboard, mouse), and basic time management.
